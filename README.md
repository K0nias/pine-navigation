# Working on the repository

PineJS comes with common tools, which help you to easily customize it and make you own builds. [GruntJS](http://gruntjs.com/) is used for the build process. If you already have it, you are ready to go. Otherwise you need node and npm on your machine. Installation of Grunt is described in [Getting Started Tutorial](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

## Dependencies

After you've set up the environment, use ```npm install``` to get all dependencies. To build the project, enter the following at the terminal:

```sh
grunt
```

Grunt can also be used to monitor files and re-build the project on each change. For this we use Grunt's watch task:

```sh
grunt watch
```

Next time you change the file, Grunt will perform all build tasks.


## Customization

TODO MS/MM

* JS variables (MS)
